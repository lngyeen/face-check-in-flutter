## Tasks / Subtasks

### **Phase 1: TDD Pre-Development**
- [ ] **Task 1**: Create Test Plan
  - [ ] Define test scenarios for each AC
  - [ ] Identify dependencies to mock
  - [ ] Prepare test fixtures and data
  - [ ] Setup test environment configuration

### **Phase 2: TDD Development (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)**
- [ ] **Task 2**: [Feature Name] - RED Phase
  - [ ] Write failing test for AC1 scenario 1
  - [ ] Write failing test for AC1 scenario 2
  - [ ] Verify tests fail for correct reasons
  
- [ ] **Task 3**: [Feature Name] - GREEN Phase
  - [ ] Implement minimal code to pass AC1 tests
  - [ ] Verify all tests pass
  - [ ] No code optimization yet
  
- [ ] **Task 4**: [Feature Name] - REFACTOR Phase
  - [ ] Improve code quality
  - [ ] Optimize performance
  - [ ] Ensure all tests still pass

### **Phase 3: TDD Comprehensive Testing**
- [ ] **Task 5**: Edge Cases & Integration
  - [ ] Add tests for error scenarios
  - [ ] Add tests for boundary conditions
  - [ ] Add integration tests if needed
  - [ ] Verify test coverage meets requirements

### **Phase 4: Documentation & Review**
- [ ] **Task 6**: Test Documentation
  - [ ] Document test rationale
  - [ ] Update testing strategy
  - [ ] Create test maintenance guide

## Dev Technical Guidance

### **TDD-Specific Requirements**
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% for business logic
- **Test Quality**: Tests should be readable, maintainable, fast
- **Test Organization**: Follow project test structure conventions
- **Mock Usage**: Use `mocktail` for dependency mocking

### **BLoC TDD Pattern**
```dart
// Example TDD approach for BLoC
group('FeatureBloc', () {
  // RED: Write failing test first
  blocTest<FeatureBloc, FeatureState>(
    'should emit success state when feature action succeeds',
    build: () => FeatureBloc(mockService),
    act: (bloc) => bloc.add(FeatureEvent.actionRequested()),
    expect: () => [
      FeatureState.loading(),
      FeatureState.success(expectedData),
    ],
  );
  
  // GREEN: Implement minimal code to pass
  // REFACTOR: Improve implementation
});
```

### **Widget TDD Pattern**
```dart
// Example TDD approach for widgets
group('FeatureWidget', () {
  testWidgets('should display loading indicator when state is loading', (tester) async {
    // RED: Write failing test
    const loadingState = FeatureState.loading();
    
    await tester.pumpWidget(
      MaterialApp(
        home: BlocProvider(
          create: (_) => mockBloc..emit(loadingState),
          child: FeatureWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
    
    // Assert loading indicator is displayed
    expect(find.byType(CircularProgressIndicator), findsOneWidget);
  });
});
```
