# Flutter Code Review Report

**Pull Request:** [feature/story-2.2-phase-1](https://github.com/lngyeen/face-check-in-flutter/pull/21)
**Story:** 2.2
**Reviewer:** dev.ide

**Status:** **REQUEST_CHANGES**

### **Overall Assessment**

This pull request successfully implements the core logic for frame capture and Base64 conversion, with a commendable use of `Isolate` for performance optimization. However, the review is blocked by a critical regression in the project's test suite. Meaningful tests for `CheckInBloc` and `WebSocketService` have been either completely removed or disabled, leaving the application's core logic without any automated verification. This introduces significant risk and must be rectified before the PR can be approved.

### **Detailed Analysis**

**1. Story Compliance: ⚠️ Partially Met**

- **AC1 (Frame Capture at 30 FPS):** ⚠️ Partially Met. The camera is initialized with `ResolutionPreset.medium`, which does not explicitly guarantee a 30 FPS frame rate. This is a known limitation of the `camera` package but should be acknowledged as the requirement is not strictly met.
- **AC2 (Base64 Conversion):** ✅ Met. The `ImageConverter` utility correctly converts `CameraImage` (YUV) to a Base64 encoded JPEG string.
- **AC11 (Performance):** ✅ Met. The use of a separate `Isolate` for the computationally intensive image conversion is an excellent implementation that directly addresses the performance requirements and prevents UI blocking.

**2. Clean Architecture: ✅ Compliant**

- The code structure adheres well to the project's Clean Architecture guidelines.
- New services (`FrameCaptureService`, `CameraServiceImpl`) and utilities (`ImageConverter`) are correctly placed within the `core` and `data` layers.
- Dependency injection annotations (`@lazySingleton`, `@LazySingleton`, `@injectable`) are used appropriately.

**3. Flutter/Dart Best Practices: ✅ Good**

- Asynchronous operations are handled correctly with `async`/`await`.
- The use of `Isolate` for heavy computation is a key best practice that has been followed.
- The `CheckInBloc` is well-structured, though its complexity highlights the need for testing. State and Event definitions are clear.

**4. Code Quality: ✅ Good**

- The code is generally readable, well-organized, and follows standard Dart conventions.
- Class and method names are descriptive and clearly convey their purpose.

**5. Testing: ❌ Critical**

This is the primary blocker for this PR's approval.
- **Misleading Test Results:** The `flutter test` command passes with an exit code of 0, but this is only because all problematic tests have been disabled.
- **`WebSocketService` Tests Disabled:** All tests within `test/core/services/websocket_service_test.dart` are explicitly disabled via a group-level `skip: true`. This leaves the entire networking service untested.
- **`CheckInBloc` Tests Removed:** All meaningful tests in `test/features/check_in/bloc/check_in_bloc_test.dart` have been commented out and replaced with a single placeholder test. Given the `CheckInBloc` is the central state management hub for the feature, this is an unacceptable regression.

### **Conclusion & Next Steps**

I am **requesting changes** for this PR. The lack of testing introduces an unacceptable level of risk. The following actions are required before this PR can be re-reviewed and approved:

1.  **Reinstate and Fix All Unit Tests:** The immediate priority is to reinstate and fix all previously disabled or removed tests for `CheckInBloc` and `WebSocketService`. The test suite must pass without artificially skipping these critical tests.
2.  **Add Test Coverage for New Code:** Write comprehensive unit tests for the new `FrameCaptureService` and the `ImageConverter` utility. These tests should cover success cases, error handling, and edge cases.
3.  **Acknowledge FPS Limitation:** Add a code comment within `CameraServiceImpl` where `ResolutionPreset.medium` is set, acknowledging that this does not strictly guarantee the 30 FPS target from the story's acceptance criteria.
