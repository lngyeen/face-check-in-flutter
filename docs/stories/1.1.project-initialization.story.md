# Story 1.1: Project Initialization & BLoC Structure

## Description
As a developer, I want to set up a new Flutter project with the required BLoC architecture and dependencies, so that we have a clean, structured foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Flutter project is created.
2. The folder structure for BLoC is established.
3. Required dependencies (`flutter_bloc`, `web_socket_channel`) are added to `pubspec.yaml`.
4. The main screen is created with a top area for the camera and a bottom area for the debug view.
5. The app runs successfully, showing the placeholder layout.

## Technical Details
- **Dependencies to Add:**
  - flutter_bloc: ^8.1.0
  - web_socket_channel: ^2.4.0
  - camera: ^0.11.0
  - permission_handler: ^11.3.0
  - freezed: ^2.5.0
  - freezed_annotation: ^2.4.0
  - build_runner: ^2.4.0
  - json_serializable: ^6.8.0

- **Folder Structure to Create:**
