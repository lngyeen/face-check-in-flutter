# Story 1.3: Implement Debug View

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a **developer**
- I want **a simple, scrollable text view on the main screen**
- so that **I can log and observe internal states and messages during development**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. A non-interactive, scrollable text area is present at the bottom of the main screen ✅
2. A logging utility is available that can append messages to this view ✅
3. This entire view must be built in a way that it can be completely removed from the production build using compile-time flags ✅
4. Debug view displays real-time application states and events ✅
5. Debug messages are timestamped and properly formatted ✅
6. Debug view has a maximum height limit to not interfere with camera preview ✅
7. Debug view can be toggled on/off during development ✅

## Story Estimation

**Story Points**: 2 SP  
**Complexity**: Low - Simple UI component + Basic logging integration  
**Risk Level**: Low - Non-critical feature, straightforward implementation  
**Estimation Method**: Planning Poker consensus (Small story)  
**Reference Stories**: Similar debug/logging UI components  
**Assumptions**: Logging service provides structured data, debug view only needed in development

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Create debug-related events in CheckInEvent
  - [x] Update CheckInBloc to emit debug messages
  - [x] Log state transitions and important events
  - [x] Ensure debug messages don't affect performance

  - [x] Create compile-time flags for debug view
  - [x] Implement conditional compilation for debug widgets
  - [x] Ensure no debug code is included in release builds
  - [x] Add build configuration documentation
  - [x] Test both debug and release builds

- [x] Task 5: Add Debug Toggle Functionality (AC: 7)
  - [x] Implement debug view show/hide functionality
  - [x] Add gesture or button to toggle debug view
  - [x] Store debug view preference state
  - [x] Ensure toggle only works in debug builds
  - [x] Test toggle functionality

- [x] Task 6: Main Screen Integration (AC: 1, 6)
  - [x] Integrate DebugViewWidget into CheckInScreen
  - [x] Position debug view at bottom of screen
  - [x] Ensure proper layout constraints
  - [x] Test with different screen sizes
  - [x] Verify camera preview is not affected

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Debug View Design Specifications
- **Position**: Bottom area of main screen, below camera preview
- **Height**: Maximum 30% of screen height, scrollable content
- **Font**: Monospace font for better log readability
- **Colors**: Use theme-appropriate contrast colors
- **Background**: Semi-transparent or distinct from main UI

### Logging Service Architecture
```dart
// Example debug service structure
class DebugLogService {
  static final DebugLogService _instance = DebugLogService._internal();
  factory DebugLogService() => _instance;
  
  void logDebug(String message);
  void logInfo(String message);
  void logWarning(String message);
  void logError(String message);
  
  Stream<List<String>> get debugStream;
}
```

### Compile-Time Flag Implementation
```dart
// Use kDebugMode or custom debug flags
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Column(
    children: [
      CameraPreviewWidget(),
      if (kDebugMode) DebugViewWidget(),
    ],
  );
}
```

### Debug Message Format
- **Timestamp**: `[HH:mm:ss.SSS]`
- **Level**: `[DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR]`
- **Source**: `[BLoC/Service/Widget]`
- **Message**: Actual log content

### Integration with BLoC Pattern
- Log all state transitions automatically
- Log important events (camera init, WebSocket messages, etc.)
- Use proper event naming for debug clarity
- Avoid logging sensitive information

### Performance Considerations
- **Message Buffer**: Limit to last 100-200 messages
- **Memory Management**: Clear old messages automatically
- **UI Updates**: Use efficient stream updates
- **Production Impact**: Zero performance impact in release builds

### Development Workflow Support
- **Real-time Debugging**: See live application flow
- **Issue Diagnosis**: Track problems during development
- **Feature Testing**: Monitor feature behavior
- **State Verification**: Confirm BLoC state changes

### Build Configuration
- **Debug Builds**: Full debug functionality enabled
- **Profile Builds**: Debug view disabled, minimal logging
- **Release Builds**: Complete removal of debug code
- **Flutter Commands**: Document specific build commands
