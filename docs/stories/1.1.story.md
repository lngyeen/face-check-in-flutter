# Story 1.1: Project Foundation & BLoC Architecture

## Status: Ready for TDD Development

## Story

- As a **developer**
- I want **to set up the Flutter project foundation with complete BLoC architecture and backend integration**
- so that **the application has a solid foundation and state management structure for all features**

## Pre-Development Test Planning

### **Test Strategy**
- [ ] **Test Approach Defined**: Unit tests for BLoC, Widget tests for app initialization, Integration tests for WebSocket
- [ ] **Mock Strategy**: Mock WebSocket service, Mock platform channels for testing
- [ ] **Test Data**: Sample WebSocket messages, Mock state transitions, Test project configurations
- [ ] **Test Environment**: Flutter test environment with bloc_test and mocktail setup

### **TDD Development Plan**
```markdown
1. **RED Phase Tests**: List of failing tests to write first
   - [ ] Test 1: Project structure validation tests
   - [ ] Test 2: BLoC state management foundation tests
   - [ ] Test 3: WebSocket service connection tests
   - [ ] Test 4: App initialization and observer tests
   
2. **GREEN Phase Implementation**: Minimal code to pass tests
   - [ ] Implementation 1: Basic project structure and dependencies
   - [ ] Implementation 2: CheckIn BLoC with initial state management
   - [ ] Implementation 3: WebSocket service with connection handling
   - [ ] Implementation 4: App widget with BLoC providers
   
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Code quality improvements

```

## Acceptance Criteria (TDD Format)

### AC1: Project Foundation Setup
**Given** the development environment is ready  
**When** Flutter project is initialized with proper naming and structure  
**Then** project should follow Clean Architecture with feature-first structure  
**And** all essential dependencies should be properly configured

**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] **Happy Path**: Project creates successfully with all dependencies and folder structure
- [ ] **Error Case**: Missing dependencies are detected and reported clearly
- [ ] **Edge Case**: Invalid project names are handled gracefully

**Test Implementation Required:**
- [ ] **Unit Test**: Project configuration validation and dependency verification
- [ ] **Widget Test**: App initialization widget tests
- [ ] **Integration Test**: End-to-end project setup verification

### AC2: BLoC Architecture Foundation
**Given** the project foundation is established  
**When** BLoC architecture is implemented with state management  
**Then** CheckIn BLoC should be created with proper state and event structure  
**And** SimpleBlocObserver should be configured for debugging

**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] **Happy Path**: BLoC creates with initial state and handles events correctly
- [ ] **Error Case**: Invalid state transitions are handled gracefully
- [ ] **Edge Case**: Multiple rapid events are processed correctly

**Test Implementation Required:**
- [ ] **Unit Test**: BLoC state transitions and event handling
- [ ] **Widget Test**: BLoC integration with UI components
- [ ] **Integration Test**: End-to-end BLoC workflow validation

### AC3: WebSocket Backend Integration
**Given** the BLoC foundation is ready  
**When** WebSocket connection is configured and tested  
**Then** connection to ws://192.168.1.234:3009 should be established  
**And** connection status should be properly managed in app state

**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] **Happy Path**: WebSocket connects successfully and maintains connection
- [ ] **Error Case**: Connection failures are handled with retry logic
- [ ] **Edge Case**: Network interruptions are handled gracefully

**Test Implementation Required:**
- [ ] **Unit Test**: WebSocket service connection management
- [ ] **Widget Test**: Connection status display in UI
- [ ] **Integration Test**: End-to-end WebSocket communication

### AC4: Code Generation & Build Verification
**Given** all architecture components are implemented  
**When** code generation is run and project is built  
**Then** all generated code should compile successfully  
**And** project should build and run on both iOS and Android

**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] **Happy Path**: Code generation produces valid Dart code
- [ ] **Error Case**: Generation errors are clearly reported
- [ ] **Edge Case**: Incremental builds work correctly

**Test Implementation Required:**
- [ ] **Unit Test**: Generated code validation
- [ ] **Widget Test**: UI components using generated code
- [ ] **Integration Test**: Full app build and launch verification

## Story Estimation

**Story Points**: 20 SP (increased from 16 SP for TDD)  
**Complexity**: High - Foundation setup + Backend integration + BLoC architecture + State management + TDD implementation  
**Risk Level**: Medium - Backend dependency, foundation setup, BLoC pattern complexity, TDD learning curve  
**TDD Effort**: 4 SP additional for comprehensive testing and TDD cycle  
**Estimation Method**: Expert judgment based on similar Flutter project setups with BLoC + TDD overhead  
**Reference Stories**: Combined estimation from foundation and BLoC setup stories + TDD pilot experience  
**Assumptions**: Backend WebSocket service is available at ws://192.168.1.234:3009, team has Flutter development environment ready, familiar with BLoC pattern, TDD training completed

```

### BLoC State Structure Design
```dart
@freezed
class CheckInState with _$CheckInState {
  const factory CheckInState({
    @Default(CameraStatus.initial) CameraStatus cameraStatus,
    @Default(ConnectionStatus.disconnected) ConnectionStatus connectionStatus,
    @Default(StreamingStatus.idle) StreamingStatus streamingStatus,
    @Default(false) bool isLoading,
    String? errorMessage,
    // Toast-related state
    @Default(ToastStatus.none) ToastStatus toastStatus,
    String? toastMessage,
  }) = _CheckInState;
}

enum CameraStatus { initial, ready, error }
enum ConnectionStatus { disconnected, connecting, connected, failed }
enum StreamingStatus { idle, active, paused, error }
enum ToastStatus { none, showing }
```

### BLoC Event Structure Design  
```dart
@freezed
class CheckInEvent with _$CheckInEvent {
  // App lifecycle events
  const factory CheckInEvent.appStarted() = AppStarted;
  
  // Camera events (placeholders for future integration)
  const factory CheckInEvent.cameraInitRequested() = CameraInitRequested;
  const factory CheckInEvent.cameraStatusChanged(CameraStatus status) = CameraStatusChanged;
  
  // WebSocket events (placeholders for future integration)  
  const factory CheckInEvent.connectionRequested() = ConnectionRequested;
  const factory CheckInEvent.connectionStatusChanged(ConnectionStatus status) = ConnectionStatusChanged;
  
  // UI events
  const factory CheckInEvent.errorOccurred(String message) = ErrorOccurred;
}
```

### Backend Integration Specifications
- **WebSocket URL**: `ws://192.168.1.234:3009` (confirmed and ready)
- **Connection Protocol**: Raw base64 image frames as per architecture
- **Response Format**: JSON with frameResult type and faces array
- **Error Handling**: 3 retry attempts with 3-second delays
- **Environment Config**: Support for dev/staging/production endpoints
- **Testing Utilities**: Connection test functions for development validation

### Connection Test Implementation
```dart
// Add to lib/core/services/websocket_service.dart
Future<bool> testConnection() async {
  try {
    final channel = WebSocketChannel.connect(
      Uri.parse('ws://192.168.1.234:3009'),
    );
    
    // Wait for connection
    await channel.ready;
    
    // Send test message
    channel.sink.add('test');
    
    // Clean up
    await channel.sink.close();
    
    print('✅ WebSocket connection successful');
    return true;
  } catch (e) {
    print('❌ Connection failed: $e');
    return false;
  }
}
```

### App Integration Pattern
```dart
// Example App widget structure
class App extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocProvider(
      create: (context) => CheckInBloc()..add(const CheckInEvent.appStarted()),
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'FaceCheckIn Employee',
        theme: ThemeData(
          primarySwatch: Colors.red, // Company brand color
        ),
        home: const CheckInScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Integration Points for Team Development
- **BLoC Services**: Ready for camera and WebSocket service integration
- **State Management**: Centralized state for all features
- **Error Handling**: Unified error state management
- **Debug Logging**: BLoC observer logs all state transitions
- **Backend Connection**: Shared WebSocket service for all features

### **TDD-Specific Requirements**
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% for business logic (BLoC and services)
- **Test Quality**: Tests should be readable, maintainable, and fast (<100ms per unit test)
- **Test Organization**: Follow project test structure with unit/widget/integration separation
- **Mock Usage**: Use `mocktail` for dependency mocking, especially WebSocket services

### **BLoC TDD Testing Patterns**
```dart
// Example TDD approach for BLoC testing
group('CheckInBloc', () {
  late CheckInBloc bloc;
  late MockWebSocketService mockWebSocketService;

  setUp(() {
    mockWebSocketService = MockWebSocketService();
    bloc = CheckInBloc(webSocketService: mockWebSocketService);
  });

  // RED: Write failing test first
  blocTest<CheckInBloc, CheckInState>(
    'should emit initial state when created',
    build: () => bloc,
    verify: (bloc) => expect(bloc.state, equals(CheckInState.initial())),
  );

  // Test state transitions
  blocTest<CheckInBloc, CheckInState>(
    'should emit [connecting, connected] when connection succeeds',
    build: () => bloc,
    setUp: () {
      when(() => mockWebSocketService.connect(any()))
          .thenAnswer((_) async => true);
    },
    act: (bloc) => bloc.add(CheckInEvent.connectionRequested()),
    expect: () => [
      CheckInState.initial().copyWith(
        connectionStatus: ConnectionStatus.connecting,
      ),
      CheckInState.initial().copyWith(
        connectionStatus: ConnectionStatus.connected,
      ),
    ],
  );
});
```

### **Quality Standards**
- **Immutable States**: Enforced by freezed annotations
- **Type Safety**: All events and states properly typed
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error state management
- **Code Generation**: Automated with build_runner
- **Linting**: Follow flutter_lints rules strictly
- **Testing**: Complete TDD test coverage with unit, widget, and integration tests
