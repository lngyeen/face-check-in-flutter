# Story 1.1: Project Foundation & BLoC Architecture

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a **developer**
- I want **to set up the Flutter project foundation with complete BLoC architecture and backend integration**
- so that **the application has a solid foundation and state management structure for all features**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. A new Flutter project is created with proper naming convention and structure
2. Core project structure and folder architecture is established for parallel development
3. Essential dependencies are added to `pubspec.yaml` including BLoC and WebSocket packages
4. BLoC foundation is implemented with proper state management setup
5. CheckIn BLoC, Event, and State files are created with basic structure
6. SimpleBlocObserver is implemented for debugging and logging
7. Code generation setup is configured and working for states
8. App initialization includes BLoC observer configuration and basic MaterialApp
9. Backend WebSocket connection configuration is ready and testable
10. Project builds successfully and can be shared with team
11. State management pattern is ready for feature implementation
12. Initial states and events are defined for check-in flow

## Story Estimation

**Story Points**: 16 SP  
**Complexity**: High - Foundation setup + Backend integration + BLoC architecture + State management  
**Risk Level**: Medium - Backend dependency, foundation setup, BLoC pattern complexity  
**Estimation Method**: Expert judgment based on similar Flutter project setups with BLoC  
**Reference Stories**: Combined estimation from foundation and BLoC setup stories  
**Assumptions**: Backend WebSocket service is available at wss://facedetection-ws.owt.vn, team has Flutter development environment ready, familiar with BLoC pattern

```

### BLoC State Structure Design
```dart
@freezed
class CheckInState with _$CheckInState {
  const factory CheckInState({
    @Default(CameraStatus.initial) CameraStatus cameraStatus,
    @Default(ConnectionStatus.disconnected) ConnectionStatus connectionStatus,
    @Default(StreamingStatus.idle) StreamingStatus streamingStatus,
    @Default(false) bool isLoading,
    String? errorMessage,
    // Toast-related state
    @Default(ToastStatus.none) ToastStatus toastStatus,
    String? toastMessage,
  }) = _CheckInState;
}

enum CameraStatus { initial, ready, error }
enum ConnectionStatus { disconnected, connecting, connected, failed }
enum StreamingStatus { idle, active, paused, error }
enum ToastStatus { none, showing }
```

### BLoC Event Structure Design  
```dart
@freezed
class CheckInEvent with _$CheckInEvent {
  // App lifecycle events
  const factory CheckInEvent.appStarted() = AppStarted;
  
  // Camera events (placeholders for future integration)
  const factory CheckInEvent.cameraInitRequested() = CameraInitRequested;
  const factory CheckInEvent.cameraStatusChanged(CameraStatus status) = CameraStatusChanged;
  
  // WebSocket events (placeholders for future integration)  
  const factory CheckInEvent.connectionRequested() = ConnectionRequested;
  const factory CheckInEvent.connectionStatusChanged(ConnectionStatus status) = ConnectionStatusChanged;
  
  // UI events
  const factory CheckInEvent.errorOccurred(String message) = ErrorOccurred;
}
```

### Backend Integration Specifications
- **WebSocket URL**: `wss://facedetection-ws.owt.vn` (confirmed and ready)
- **Connection Protocol**: Raw base64 image frames as per architecture
- **Response Format**: JSON with frameResult type and faces array
- **Error Handling**: 3 retry attempts with 3-second delays
- **Environment Config**: Support for dev/staging/production endpoints
- **Testing Utilities**: Connection test functions for development validation

### Connection Test Implementation
```dart
// Add to lib/core/services/websocket_service.dart
Future<bool> testConnection() async {
  try {
    final channel = WebSocketChannel.connect(
      Uri.parse('wss://facedetection-ws.owt.vn'),
    );
    
    // Wait for connection
    await channel.ready;
    
    // Send test message
    channel.sink.add('test');
    
    // Clean up
    await channel.sink.close();
    
    print('✅ WebSocket connection successful');
    return true;
  } catch (e) {
    print('❌ Connection failed: $e');
    return false;
  }
}
```

### App Integration Pattern
```dart
// Example App widget structure
class App extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocProvider(
      create: (context) => CheckInBloc()..add(const CheckInEvent.appStarted()),
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'FaceCheckIn Employee',
        theme: ThemeData(
          primarySwatch: Colors.red, // Company brand color
        ),
        home: const CheckInScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Integration Points for Team Development
- **BLoC Services**: Ready for camera and WebSocket service integration
- **State Management**: Centralized state for all features
- **Error Handling**: Unified error state management
- **Debug Logging**: BLoC observer logs all state transitions
- **Backend Connection**: Shared WebSocket service for all features

### Quality Standards
- **Immutable States**: Enforced by freezed annotations
- **Type Safety**: All events and states properly typed
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error state management
- **Code Generation**: Automated with build_runner
- **Linting**: Follow flutter_lints rules strictly
