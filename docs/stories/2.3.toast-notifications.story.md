# Story 2.3: Process Backend Responses & Display Toasts

## Description
As a user, I want to see immediate feedback via a Toast notification when the backend sends a recognition result, so that I know if my check-in was successful or not.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The app listens for incoming WebSocket messages.
2. On a "success" message, a success Toast is displayed with the user's name.
3. On a "failure" message, a failure Toast is displayed.
4. All Toasts automatically disappear after 3 seconds.

## Technical Details
- **Toast Widget:**
  - Create reusable `ToastWidget` component
  - Support success and failure states
  - Implement auto-hide functionality
  - Add smooth animations

- **Message Processing:**
  - Parse WebSocket messages
  - Extract user information from success messages
  - Handle different message types
  - Validate message format

- **State Management:**
  - Add new states to `CheckInState`:
    - `RecognitionSuccess`
    - `RecognitionFailure`
    - `ToastDisplaying`

- **UI/UX:**
  - Success Toast: Green background with user's name
  - Failure Toast: Orange/Red background
  - Smooth fade in/out animations
  - Non-intrusive positioning
