# Story 1.3: Implement Debug View

## Description
As a developer, I want a simple, scrollable text view on the main screen, so that I can log and observe internal states and messages during development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A non-interactive, scrollable text area is present at the bottom of the main screen.
2. A logging utility is available that can append messages to this view.
3. This entire view must be built in a way that it can be completely removed from the production build using compile-time flags.

## Technical Details
- **Debug View Widget:**
  - Create `DebugViewWidget` component
  - Implement scrollable text area
  - Add timestamp to each log message
  - Support different log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

- **Logging Utility:**
  - Create `DebugLogger` class
  - Support different log levels
  - Format messages with timestamps
  - Maintain a circular buffer of recent logs

- **Build Configuration:**
  - Add `--dart-define=ENABLE_DEBUG_VIEW=true` for debug builds
  - Debug view should be completely excluded in release builds

- **State Management:**
  - Add debug messages to relevant state changes
  - Log WebSocket connection status
  - Log camera initialization steps
  - Log permission changes

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Debug view is completely removed in release builds
- [ ] Log messages are properly formatted with timestamps
- [ ] Log messages are scrollable
- [ ] Recent logs are preserved in memory
- [ ] All major state changes are logged
- [ ] Code follows the project's linting rules
