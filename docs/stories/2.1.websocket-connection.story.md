# Story 2.1: Establish WebSocket Connection Automatically

## Description
As a developer, I want to automatically establish a WebSocket connection to the backend server as soon as the app is ready, so that video data can be streamed for recognition without user interaction.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A WebSocket service is created to manage connection logic.
2. After the camera is initialized, the app automatically attempts to connect to the WebSocket URL.
3. Connection status ("Connecting...", "Established", "Failed") is logged to the debug view.
4. The connection is gracefully closed when the app is terminated.

## Technical Details
- **WebSocket Service:**
  - Create `WebSocketService` class
  - Implement connection management
  - Handle reconnection logic (3 attempts, 3-second delay)
  - Implement message sending/receiving

- **State Management:**
  - Add new states to `CheckInState`:
    - `WebSocketConnecting`
    - `WebSocketConnected`
    - `WebSocketDisconnected`
    - `WebSocketError`

- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement timeout handling (30 seconds)
  - Handle connection failures
  - Implement reconnection strategy
  - Log all connection events

- **Configuration:**
  - WebSocket URL should be configurable
  - Connection timeout settings
  - Reconnection attempt settings

## Definition of Done
- [ ] WebSocket service is implemented
- [ ] Connection is established automatically after camera initialization
- [ ] Connection status is properly logged
- [ ] Reconnection logic works as specified
- [ ] Connection is properly closed on app termination
- [ ] All error cases are handled
- [ ] Code follows the project's linting rules
