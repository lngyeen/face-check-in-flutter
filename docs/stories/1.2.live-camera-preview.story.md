# Story 1.2: Implement Live Camera Preview & Auto-Start

## Description
As a user, I want the application to show a live video feed from the camera immediately after granting permission, so that the check-in process can begin automatically.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The application correctly requests and handles camera permissions on startup.
2. If permission is granted, the live camera preview is displayed and the app transitions to a "streaming" state.
3. If permission is denied, a message is shown asking the user to grant camera permissions.

## Technical Details
- **Camera Setup:**
  - Use the `camera` package to access device camera
  - Initialize camera controller in `CheckInBloc`
  - Handle camera lifecycle (initialize, dispose)

- **Permission Handling:**
  - Use `permission_handler` package
  - Request camera permission on app start
  - Show appropriate UI based on permission status

- **State Management:**
  - Add new states to `CheckInState`:
    - `Initial`
    - `PermissionRequested`
    - `PermissionDenied`
    - `CameraInitializing`
    - `Streaming`
    - `Error`

- **UI Components:**
  - Create `CameraPreviewWidget` to display live feed
  - Add permission request dialog
  - Add error handling UI
