   - **Mitigation**: Early prototyping, frequent testing, Senior Dev #1 focus
   - **Contingency**: Simplify frame processing if needed

2. **Camera Integration (Story 1.2)** - Device-specific compatibility
   - **Risk**: Permission issues, device compatibility
   - **Mitigation**: Test on multiple devices early, QA involvement
   - **Contingency**: Focus on primary target devices first

3. **WebSocket Reliability (Story 2.1)** - Network layer dependencies
   - **Risk**: Connection failures, backend unavailability
   - **Mitigation**: Robust error handling, connection retry logic
   - **Contingency**: Mock backend for development/testing

### **Medium-Risk Items:**
1. **Integration Points** - Epic 1 ↔ Epic 2 coordination
   - **Risk**: Interface mismatches, timing issues
   - **Mitigation**: Senior Dev #1 leads integration, frequent sync
   - **Contingency**: Additional integration day if needed

2. **Performance Targets** - 3-second recognition requirement
   - **Risk**: Optimization challenges, streaming performance
   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing throughout sprint
   - **Contingency**: Adjust frame rate or quality if needed
