**AI-Enhanced Capacity Planning:**
- Base Capacity (Traditional): [X] SP
- AI Productivity Multipliers Applied: [Details]
- AI-Enhanced Capacity: [Y] SP
- Sustainable Target: [Y] SP (90% of AI-enhanced)
- Buffer Allocation: [Z] SP (10% for integration & optimization)
- Technical Debt: [W] SP (10-15%)

**AI Suitability Breakdown:**
- ✅ AI-Excellent Stories: [X] SP ([%] of sprint)
- 🟡 AI-Good Stories: [Y] SP ([%] of sprint)
- 🔴 AI-Challenging Stories: [Z] SP ([%] of sprint)

## 📋 AI-Optimized Sprint Backlog

### **Core Sprint Stories**
| P | ID | Story Title | Story File | Assignee | SP | Complexity | Risk | Status | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [ID] | [Story Title] | `docs/stories/[id].story.md` | [Name] | [SP] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [Draft/Approved/InProgress/Review/Done] | [Deps] |

### **Additional Scope (Enhanced Capacity)**

| Priority | Category | SP | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Category] | [SP] | [Description of enhancement work] |

### **Story File Management:**
- **Location**: All stories located in `docs/stories/`
- **Naming Convention**: `{epic_number}.{story_number}.story.md`
- **Status Tracking**: The `Status` column in the table above is the single source of truth. The status flow is: `Draft` -> `Approved` -> `InProgress` -> `Review` -> `Done`.
- **Story Details**: Full details for each story (like Acceptance Criteria) are in its corresponding `.md` file.
