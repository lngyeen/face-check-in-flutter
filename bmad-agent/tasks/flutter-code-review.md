# Flutter Code Review Task

## Purpose

To perform comprehensive code review of pull requests by analyzing the code changes against story requirements, project standards, and Flutter best practices. This task ensures code quality, adherence to project guidelines, and proper implementation of story acceptance criteria before merging.

## Inputs for this Task

- **Branch name** (provided by user when task is initiated)
- **Story file** (automatically located based on branch naming convention or user specification)
- **Project standards** (from `docs/operational-guidelines.md`)
- **Current codebase** (for context and comparison)
- **DoD checklist** (from `bmad-agent/checklists/story-dod-checklist.md`)

## Task Execution Instructions

### 1. Gather Review Context

**Branch Information Collection:**
- Ask user: "What branch should I review? Please provide the branch name."
- If branch follows naming convention (e.g., `feature/epic-X-story-Y`), extract story reference
- If no clear story reference in branch name, ask: "Which story file should I reference for this review? (e.g., `1.2.story.md`)"

**Pull Code and Analyze Changes:**
- Execute: `git fetch origin`
- Execute: `git checkout {branch-name}`
- Execute: `git diff main...{branch-name} --name-only` to get changed files
- Execute: `git diff main...{branch-name}` to get detailed changes
- Document all changed files and their modification types (new, modified, deleted)

### 2. Load Story Context

**Story File Analysis:**
- Locate and read story file: `docs/stories/{epic}.{story}.story.md`
- Extract and document:
  - Story title and description
  - Acceptance criteria (ACs)
  - Technical requirements
  - Dependencies mentioned
  - DoD requirements specific to this story
- If story file is not found or unclear, ask user for clarification

### 3. Load Project Standards
