## TODO - Development Process Improvements

### ðŸš€ Vibe Coding Optimization
1. **Optimize sprint planning files for vibe coding compatibility:**
   - [ ] `bmad-agent/tasks/create-sprint-planning.md` - Update workflow to align with vibe coding patterns
   - [ ] `bmad-agent/templates/sprint-planning-tmpl.md` - Adjust template for AI-enhanced development with vibe coding
   - [ ] `bmad-agent/checklists/sprint-planning-checklist.md` - Optimize checklist for vibe coding workflow

2. **Create branch naming rule:**
   - [ ] Create rule in `.cursor/rules/` to define branch naming convention when agents perform tasks
   - [ ] Ensure consistent naming convention across all agents
   - [ ] Integrate into workflow of dev agents (Flutter Dev, Full Stack Dev, Frontend Dev)

### ðŸ“‹ Improvement Details

- **Vibe Coding Integration**: Optimize sprint planning files to better leverage vibe coding capabilities for rapid and efficient code generation
- **AI-Human Collaboration**: Improve coordination process between AI and humans in sprint planning
- **Context Management**: Optimize context management for AI tools during sprint execution

#### Branch Naming Rule
- **Consistency**: Ensure all agents use the same convention when creating branches
- **Traceability**: Easy to trace back from branch to task and the agent that performed it
- **Integration**: Integrate with git workflow and CI/CD pipeline
